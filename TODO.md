# TODO

- [ ] Customised install scripts ('normal', 'extended', 'minimal', 'custom' like setups - individual components, etc)

  - [ ] Stage `.zshrc` and other general files from existing setups.

  - [ ] KVM / QEMU configs and setup within installs (looking glass, hypervisor OS, etc)

  - [ ] Maybe.. container / workstation deployment with VNC? Would be interesting.
